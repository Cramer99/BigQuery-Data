# BigQuery SQL Projects

This repository contains a collection of SQL queries written and executed using **Google BigQuery**. These queries were developed for data exploration, transformation (ETL), and analysis using public datasets and sandbox projects on Google Cloud Platform.

## ðŸŒŸ Overview

The purpose of this repo is to:

- Demonstrate proficiency in SQL and working with large-scale datasets in BigQuery
- Show examples of real-world data analysis and reporting use cases
- Document clean, modular SQL workflows that can be reused or adapted

Each query is written with readability, efficiency, and reusability in mind.
